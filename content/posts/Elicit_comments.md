It is important to be receptive to others’ ideas and opinions. Tell us about a time when you had to elicit comments or feedback from another team member on an important issue?  

Probing Questions:
•	How did you let them know that you were interested in what they had to say? 
•	What questions did you ask?	
•	In the end did you have a good idea of that person’s ideas about the issue?
•	What was the end result?

Be receptive to ideas: open to ideas
Elicit comments: draw out comments

I facilitated the meeting.
Managed workload among coworkers.


Revision 2017.01
Situation: There was a time when I returned a report to an analyst, Chantelle, and showed her a couple of errors. I just pointed her the fact.  She commented that I was condescending.  I did not get it, so I asked her 1) why she felt that way.  Judgement, cold. 2) what should I say? “Could you please look into it again?”

Results: I got her point.  I learned how to deliver constructive feedback.
