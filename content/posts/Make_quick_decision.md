Q: Give an example of a time in which you had to be relatively quick in coming to a decision.  
[collected from 150 interview questions]  

Sample excellent response:  
This happens often in the IT industry, but one recent example was when we had a core backbone switch die. It died at the worst possible time — during exams — as they always seem to do, and I needed to get it back up and running quickly. I analyzed the logs and system status, and using my previous experience, I made some quick decisions that rectified the problem and got the equipment back up only minutes later.
