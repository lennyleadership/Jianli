high level: 12 years of experience in laboratory analysis for environmental monitoring and drinking water safety, and learned R.

low level: Data processing, interpretation, and presentation.  1) implemented VBA at AECL. 2) implemented R at LifeLabs. 3) implemented R for personal business.



Understanding the quality control and quality assurance, instrumentation, help me to

This job requires resilience, detail-oriented.  

My project report would be a publication of dataset to ensure data quality.  Data can't be used until they are validated.



Note: may need to host face-to-face workshop


I don't know the workflow.
