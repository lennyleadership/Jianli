voluntary work for the community.  

Winnipeg data science meetup, R user meetup, DAMA meetup

This job requires resilience, detail-oriented.  

My project report would be a publication of dataset to ensure data quality.  Data can't be used until they are validated.



Note: may need to host face-to-face workshop


I don't know the workflow.

I have 14 years of experience in laboratory analysis for environmental monitoring and drinking water safety.  I love to work with data, therefore, during job transition, I upgraded my skills in R, data processing and data analysis.  I can bring my expertise in lab analysis and skills in R and data analysis to this position.  

In my career, I have performed accredited analysis of inorganic, organic, microbiological, and radiological characteristics in different environmental matrices, such as surface water, ground water, drinking water, effluent, soil.  I also reviewed and authorized analysis reports.  As a result, I was trained to discern the data quality.  It could help me to validate data at the position.  

All these data were submitted to different regulatory compliance agencies.  I created a VBA program to transform our data to uploadable format. I also got involved in developing an Environmental Data Management System at the early stage at AECL.  I think it would not take long time to get familiar with your database.  

In the previous jobs, I developed visual basic for applications in Excel for data processing, data review, and data upload.  I developed Shiny app for quality control and instrument monitoring.  In the future jobs, I could use these skills to: 1) convert data to comply with DataStream's schema; 2) validate data quality; 3) tell story of data.  

Overall, I have a passion to work with data and utilize my experience and knowledge in environmental monitoring and environmental science to support DataStream.
