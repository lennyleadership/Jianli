(CGC, ISO quality officer, 2016.10)

situation: A coworker raised voice, and commented that I had no clue on ICP analysis.
[Comments: I raised a red flag.  大忌]

It is a situational question.  Use different approaches when dealing with different personality.

Scenario #1: Kent Feluschko, training, AECL
one-on-one discussion,  took initiative, problem solved, relationship built, no hidden agenda.

Scenario #2: Chantelle Kryschuke, ICP results, AECL
problem not solved at the first place, leveraged co-worker's support to solve disagreement, and backed by supervisor's support.
