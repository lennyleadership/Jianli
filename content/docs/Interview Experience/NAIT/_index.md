) When I recalled Paolo's introduction about this position in the first interview, he emphasized on "deep expertise in chemical characterization".  I mentioned about the data analysis report a couple of times in the follow-up interview.  I think I distracted (or left impression with) them with my data analysis.  

) I could mention how my experience in GC/MS, HPLC, ICP-OES, DSC, and TGA could help them, such as design of experiment, ANOVA for method development, process/instrument optimization. my plan of building database of troubleshooting, faster data processing.   

) 

Most of potential employers do not have impression on data analysis.  That is my skill that makes me stands out from candidates.
